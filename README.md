# Diabetes Prediction System

## Description

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. It utilizes a dataset containing various health-related features and applies a predictive model to determine the probability of diabetes occurrence. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, as well as empower individuals to monitor their health effectively.

## Introduction

The Diabetes Prediction System is designed to provide accurate predictions on the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. By analyzing various health-related features, the system utilizes machine learning techniques to classify individuals as either having diabetes or not. This can aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, leading to improved patient outcomes.

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model from scratch to predict diabetes. The SVM algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in handling classification tasks. The model is trained on a labeled dataset that includes features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and skin thickness. These features are used to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals based on their diabetes status.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for training and testing the Diabetes Prediction System contains information from individuals, including their health records and diabetes diagnosis status. The features include:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in meters)^2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
- Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

These features provide valuable information about an individual's health and can contribute to predicting the likelihood of developing diabetes.

## Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing features, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. Model Training: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is implemented from scratch, utilizing gradient descent or other optimization techniques to learn the model's parameters.
3. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its predictive capability.
4. Prediction System: The developed model is integrated into an application where users can input their health-related features and obtain real-time predictions on the likelihood of developing diabetes.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The programming language used for implementing the SVM model, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics calculation.
- Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for developing and running the project code.
- NumPy and Pandas: Libraries utilized for data manipulation and feature extraction.
- Scikit-learn: Library used for implementing the SVM model and evaluating its performance.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization, including scatter plots, violin plots, and line plots.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Neural Networks, or Gradient Boosting to compare and improve the model's performance.
- Incorporate more advanced feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for diabetes prediction.
- Develop a user-friendly web interface to facilitate easy interaction with the system

 and provide visualizations of prediction results.
- Continuously update the model with new data to enhance its accuracy and adaptability to changing demographics and health trends.
- Collaborate with healthcare professionals to validate and further refine the system's predictive capabilities.
